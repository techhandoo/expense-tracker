Project Description: Expense Tracker with Tkinter GUI

The Expense Tracker with Tkinter GUI is a simple and user-friendly software application designed to help individuals manage their daily expenses efficiently. The project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library in Python, allowing users to easily add, view, and delete expenses in real-time. The main objective of this project is to enable users to track their spending, gain insights into their financial habits, and maintain better control over their finances.

Key Features:
1. Add Expenses: Users can input their expenses by providing the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), expense category, and the amount spent. The application stores this information in a text file named "expenses.txt" for future reference.

2. View Expenses: The Expense Tracker displays all recorded expenses in a tabular format. It presents details such as the date, expense category, and amount, along with a total expense calculated from the accumulated amounts.

3. Delete Expenses: Users can delete any unwanted expense from the list by selecting the corresponding entry and clicking the "Delete Expense" button. The entry will be removed from both the GUI and the "expenses.txt" file.

4. User-Friendly Interface: The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly design, making it easy for users to interact with the application. The input fields and buttons are well-labeled, guiding users through the expense management process.

5. Persistent Data Storage: The application ensures data persistence by storing expenses in the "expenses.txt" file. This allows users to access their recorded expenses even after closing and reopening the application.

Benefits:
- Simplified Expense Tracking: Users can effortlessly track their daily expenses, categorize them, and evaluate their spending habits over time.

- Financial Awareness: By visualizing their expenses in a table and the total amount spent, users gain a better understanding of their financial patterns, making it easier to identify areas for potential savings.

- Time-Saving: The GUI interface streamlines the process of adding and managing expenses, saving users time and effort in manual calculations and record-keeping.

- Customizable and Extendable: The project provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as adding filters, sorting options, charts, or exporting data to other formats.

Technology Stack:
- Python: The core programming language used to develop the Expense Tracker application.
- Tkinter: A standard Python GUI toolkit utilized to create the graphical user interface.
- Text File I/O: Python's file handling capabilities enable data persistence by reading and writing expenses to the "expenses.txt" file.

Overall, the Expense Tracker with Tkinter GUI serves as a practical tool for personal finance management. Whether it's for tracking daily expenses, setting budget goals, or understanding financial trends, this project empowers users to achieve better financial control and make informed financial decisions.
